# Tornado Pool [![Build Status](https://github.com/tornadocash/tornado-pool/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tornadocash/tornado-pool/actions)

This an experimental version of tornado.cash that allows to deposit **arbitrary amounts** and make **internal(shielded) transfers**.

Other facts about this version:

1. It uses L2 (xdai). Xdai has a ETH(mainnet)<>WETH(xdai) bridge that will be used under hood.
2. Contracts will be upgradable by tornado-cash governance! xdai bridge supports transferring messages from L1 to L2 and vice versa, so community can always upgrade tornado-pool to a new version in case of an issue.
3. Since it's a beta version, deposits are limited by 1ETH. Governance can always increase the limit.
4. Withdrawal amount from pool to L1 has to be larger than 0.05 ETH to prevent spam attack on the bridge.
5. The code was [audited](./resources/Zeropool-Tornado.pool-audit.pdf) by Igor Gulamov from Zeropool.

Check config.js for actual values.

With `salt` = `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000047941987` addresses must be:

1. `L1Unwrapper` - `0x3F615bA21Bc6Cc5D4a6D798c5950cc5c42937fbd`
2. `TornadoPool` - `0x0CDD3705aF7979fBe80A64288Ebf8A9Fe1151cE1`

Check addresses with current config:

```shell
yarn compile
node -e 'require("./src/0_generateAddresses").generateWithLog()'
```

Deploy L1Unwrapper:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deployL1Unwrapper.js --network mainnet
